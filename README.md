This project is a basic music player developed in C, utilizing data structures, particularly linked lists. It uses a circular doubly linked list to manage and navigate through a playlist of songs, allowing for functionalities such as playing the next song, previous song, first song, last song, and a specific song chosen by the user. The project also incorporates file handling to read and write song data. Upon running the program, users are presented with a menu of songs and can select the playback order according to their preference, ensuring a customizable listening experience.
